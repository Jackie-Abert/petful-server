# Petful Server

The FIFO app is a pet adoption system using queue to ensure fairness and to ensure pets get adopted and not left behind at the shelter. Adopters enter a queue to take a turn adopting. Cats and Dogs are both entered in their own queues, from which adopters can adopt a cat, a dog, or both from the front of their respective queues..
